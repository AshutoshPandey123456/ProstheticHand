# Prosthetic Hand

This project is a prototype for an affordable, modular, myoelectric prosthetic arm. It was one of the entries for Dassault Systemes Aakruti Design contest 2019 and came among the top 3 in the south zone regionals in India among 5000+ teams. It is made out 3D printed ABS plastic and uses TPU material for joints. A detailed description of the project and its features can be found in the DIY report of this repository and the Powerpoint Presentation. All the CAD files are in SolidWorks and can be used to 3D print the prosthesis in any 3D printer.

The electronics component for myoelectric control is still under development, and the repository will be updated when it is done.
